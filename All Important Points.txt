6. Clean Code by Robert Cecil Martin => Since I read this book, I completely changed my way to code. Before, I was focusing on algorithmic
    performance. Now, I focus more on maintainability and cleanliness. In the end, what costs a lot is not the computer, it's the 
    human resources, so you better code clean for your projects. Even bad code can function. But if code isn't clean, it can bring a 
    development organization to its knees. Instead of high-level processes, Clean Code focuses on specific tactical principles, such as
    how to write classes and functions.
